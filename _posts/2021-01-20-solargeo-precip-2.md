While we are confident that solar geoengineering will reduce the Earthâ€™s surface temperature, its impact on precipitation merits further consideration. Early influential studies showed that solar geoengineering may disrupt the summer monsoons in Africa and Asia ([Robock et al. 2008](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2008JD010050)). However, more recent research found that the climate outcome of stratospheric aerosol injection depends on the location ([Kravitz et al. 2019](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019JD030329)), quantity, and season ([Visioni et al. 2020](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020GL088337)) of injection and type of reflectant used ([Seeley et al. 2020](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020GL090876)). It's not yet clear how these affect precipitation patterns.

As discussed in a [previous post](https://matthewjhenry.github.io/posts/2020/11/solargeo-precip/), the spectral properties of the reflectant can lead to a reduction in precipitation as the combination of CO2 and shortwave reduction leads a residual atmospheric forcing (blue below). One can tweak the spectral properties of the reflectant to offset the residual atmospheric forcing and cancel the reduction in precipitation (green below).

The stratospheric heating alone can also cause changes in precipitation. [Simpson et al. (2019)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2019JD031093#jgrd55874-fig-0016) analyze simulations where stratospheric aerosols are injected to maintain the surface temperature, latitudinal surface temperature gradient, and interhemispheric difference in an RCP8.5 (high emissions) scenario. They compare them with simulations where the stratospheric heating alone is added to the base climate. Though, the changes in precipitation are lower, the pattern in change in strikingly similar to the stratospheric aerosol injection simulation (their figures 6 and 7), especially in the tropics.

To better understand how stratospheric heating alone can affect precipitation, they do a prescribed SST aquaplanet experiment with an idealized zonal asymmetry, and add the same prescribed stratospheric heating perturbation. The result (below) is noisy but there is a dry-get-wetter and wet-get-drier pattern. The authors indicate that more investigations in this idealized context are on the way to get a mechanistic understanding of how stratospheric heating affects precipitation.

Often, people model solar geoengineering by 'turning down the sun', but stratospheric heating, along with changes in cloud radiative forcing, and differences in the latitudinal pattern in radiative forcing are key differences between stratospheric aerosol injection and turning down the sun [(Visioni et al. 2020)](https://www.essoar.org/doi/10.1002/essoar.10504448.1). These other differences may also affect precipitation.
