Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Exeter, working with Prof. [Goeff Vallis](http://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/people/staff/gv219/). You can view my CV [here](http://meteo.mcgill.ca/~mhenry/files/cv-mhenry.pdf).

The main theme of my research is using idealized climate models to have a better understanding of the climate system. I have done some work on understanding why the polar regions warm faster under increased greenhouse gas forcing ("Polar amplification"). I am currently working on understanding past warm climates, such as the Eocene, which were characterised by a small equator-to-pole temperature difference and above-freezing winter temperatures on the Arctic continent.

I am also broadly interested in solar geoengineering as a means to give us more time to transition to a carbon-neutral economy.

I enjoy doing outreach. You can find a write up of my Pint of Science talk [here](https://matthewjhenry.github.io/posts/2019/05/PoS-Talk/) and my tweets from @EnDirectDuLabo which encourages scientists to do outreach (in French) [here](https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3AEnDirectDuLabo%20since%3A2020-04-13%20until%3A2020-04-19&src=typed_query).

Feel free to reach out if you want to discuss projects (academic, outreach, or other).
