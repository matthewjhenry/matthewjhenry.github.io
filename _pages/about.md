Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Exeter, working with Prof. [Geoff Vallis](http://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/people/staff/gv219/). You can view my CV [here](https://matthewjhenry.github.io/CV_Henry.pdf).

The main theme of my research is using idealized climate models to have a better understanding of the climate system. 

My PhD was on why the high latitudes warm faster than the rest of the planet as greenhouse gas concentrations are increased. I am currently working on understanding warm climates of the past such as the Eocene (50 million years ago, ~14 degrees warmer than today!). I also have a side project on understanding precipitation changes under solar geoengineering scenarios.

Feel free to reach out if you want to discuss projects (academic, outreach, or other).
