Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Exeter, working with Prof. [Goeff Vallis](http://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/people/staff/gv219/). You can view my CV [here](http://meteo.mcgill.ca/~mhenry/files/cv-mhenry.pdf).

The main theme of my research is using idealized climate models to have a better understanding of the climate system. I have done some work on understanding why the polar regions warm faster under increased greenhouse gas forcing ("Polar amplification"). I am currently working on understanding past warm climates, such as the Eocene, which were characterised by a small equator-to-pole temperature difference and above-freezing winter temperatures on the Arctic continent.

I am also broadly interested in solar geoengineering as a means to give us more time to transition to a carbon-neutral economy.

I enjoy doing outreach. You can find a write up of my Pint of Science talk [here](https://matthewjhenry.github.io/notes/2019/05/19/PoS-talk-outreach) and my tweets from @EnDirectDuLabo which encourages scientists to do outreach (in French) [here](https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3AEnDirectDuLabo%20since%3A2020-04-13%20until%3A2020-04-19&src=typed_query).

Feel free to reach out if you want to discuss projects (academic, outreach, or other).

07/07/2020 - I was invited to give a presentation on my PhD work as part of the Scripps journal club (online!). Recorded <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q93JCzOlzY'>here</a> and was followed by an interesting conversation. Thank you for the invite!

06/29/2020 - I gave a poster presentation for the <a href="https://sites.google.com/cam.ac.uk/climatedynamics/home">6th UK National Climate Dynamics Workshop</a> on some very preliminary results on how the combination of low surface heat capacity of land and the Stefan-Boltzmann nonlinearity (again!) leads to increased warming in winter and decreased warming in summer over high latitude land relative to high latitude ocean.

03/01/2020 - I joined the research group in Exeter with <a href="http://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/people/staff/gv219/">Prof. Goeff Vallis</a>.

02/15/2020 - I finished a long walk from Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port to Compostelle along the Camino Frances (769 km)!</a>

12/06/2019 - I defended my PhD! My thesis entitled "Polar Amplification: what does the Temperature Feedback have to do with it?" is available <a href="https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ww72bh08q">here</a>.
