23/03/2021 - I co-hosted a little seminar with the Exeter and Bristol groups on paleoclimates, and presented on my recent Eocene work.

17/03/2021 - I joined my PhD group at McGill University for a presentation on my Eocene work, and a "visit". It was great to catch up!

22/10/2020 - I gave a talk on my new work on the seasonality of high latitude surface temperature change in an idealized GCM with no clouds or sea ice to the Climate Dynamics group in Exeter. There should be a pre-print coming out soon-ish.

07/07/2020 - I was invited to give a presentation on my PhD work as part of the Scripps journal club (online!). Recorded <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q93JCzOlzY'>here</a> and was followed by an interesting conversation. Thank you for the invite!

06/29/2020 - I gave a poster presentation for the <a href="https://sites.google.com/cam.ac.uk/climatedynamics/home">6th UK National Climate Dynamics Workshop</a> on some very preliminary results on how the combination of low surface heat capacity of land and the Stefan-Boltzmann nonlinearity (again!) leads to increased warming in winter and decreased warming in summer over high latitude land relative to high latitude ocean.

03/01/2020 - I joined the research group in Exeter with <a href="http://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/people/staff/gv219/">Prof. Goeff Vallis</a>.

02/15/2020 - I finished a long walk from Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port to Compostelle along the Camino Frances (769 km)!

12/06/2019 - I defended my PhD! My thesis entitled "Polar Amplification: what does the Temperature Feedback have to do with it?" is available <a href="https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/ww72bh08q">here</a>.
